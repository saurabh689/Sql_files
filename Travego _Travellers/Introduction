GLCA SQL Week 02 - Graded Project

Travego Travellers

Introduction
Let’s assume that you have to keep the record of the passengers and price to travel between two cities by bus,
for types (Sitting and Sleeper).
The focus of this project is to learn to write different types SQL statements to insert and retrieve data from a
database. For database storage we will use MySQL, information related to MySQL and several commands
have already been discussed in weekly notebooks. You can refer to these to gather hints on functionality.


The simple program is structured in various layers.

1. To give an insight we have two tables Passenger and Price. Please find the more details in the
attached ER diagram.



2. Following is the sample data. Please insert this data in the table Passenger. Do ensure that you have
at least these data points available in the tables.

1 Sejal AC F Bengaluru Chennai 350 Sleeper
2 Anmol Non-AC M Mumbai Hyderabad 700 Sitting
3 Pallavi AC F Panaji Bengaluru 600 Sleeper
4 Khusboo AC F Chennai Mumbai 1500 Sleeper
5 Udit Non-AC M Trivandrum Panaji 1000 Sleeper
6 Ankur AC M Nagpur Hyderabad 500 Sitting
7 Hemant Non-AC M Panaji Mumbai 700 Sleeper
8 Manish Non-AC M Hyderabad Bengaluru 500 Sitting
9 Piyush AC M Pune Nagpur 700 Sitting
Insert the following data in the table Price
id Bus_type Distance Price
1 Sleeper 350 770
2 Sleeper 500 1100
3 Sleeper 600 1320
4 Sleeper 700 1540
5 Sleeper 1000 2200
6 Sleeper 1200 2640
7 Sleeper 1500 2700
8 Sitting 500 620
9 Sitting 600 744
10 Sitting 700 868
11 Sitting 1000 1240
12 Sitting 1200 1488
13 Sitting 1500 1860



Problem Statement
In this project you have to do the following activities…
● Create the two tables
● Insert data in these tables
● Retrieve the data from these tables based on the requirements mentioned below
1. (Easy) Creating the schema and required tables using MySQL workbench
a. Create a schema named Travego and create the tables mentioned above with the mentioned
column names. Also, declare the relevant datatypes for each feature/column in the dataset. (5
marks)
b. Insert the data in the newly created tables. (3 marks)
2. (Medium) Perform read operation on the designed table created in the above task.
a. How many female passengers traveled a minimum distance of 600 KMs? (1 mark)
b. Write a query to display the passenger details whose travel distance is greater than 500 and
who are traveling in a sleeper bus. (2 marks)
c. Select passenger names whose names start with the character 'S'.(2 marks)
d. Calculate the price charged for each passenger, displaying the Passenger name, Boarding City,
Destination City, Bus type, and Price in the output. (3 marks)
e. What are the passenger name(s) and the ticket price for those who traveled 1000 KMs Sitting in
a bus? (4 marks)
f. What will be the Sitting and Sleeper bus charge for Pallavi to travel from Bangalore to Panaji? (5
marks)
g. Alter the column category with the value "Non-AC" where the Bus_Type is sleeper (2 marks)
h. Delete an entry from the table where the passenger name is Piyush and commit this change in
the database. (1 mark)
i. Truncate the table passenger and comment on the number of rows in the table (explain if
required). (1 mark)
j. Delete the table passenger from the database. (1 mark)
Expected files
1. SQL scripts for Table creation and data insertion in the table. Task-1
2. SQL scripts for all the select queries. Task-2.


Program Instructions
1. You need MySQL installed in your system to verify the scripts that you are writing. Do install MySQL
and MySQL Workbench.
                                                                                
2. Write the SQL scripts that will have all the required statements to perform Task-1 and Task-2.
                                                                                
3. Once the program is ready to submit, zip the parent folder C04-Project02-Travego Travelers, and
upload the new zip file as C04-Project02-Travego Travellers.zip. It is now ready for evaluation.
